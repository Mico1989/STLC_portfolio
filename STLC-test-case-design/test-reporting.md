## Scenario 1: Invalid Expiration Date Format

As a user of GroceryMate, I want to purchase a product but I'm blocked due to the expiration date field not accepting a valid format.

###  Bug Summary:
Rating functionality is blocked because the purchase flow is not completed.  
Since the user cannot complete the order due to a bug in the expiration field, rating becomes inaccessible.
